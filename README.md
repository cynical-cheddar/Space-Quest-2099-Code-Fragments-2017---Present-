![enter image description here](https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1860550/extras/mediumTop.png?t=1664316779)

Only a subset of code. This is because the full source code is damn near 25 GB, and it just wouldn't be fair on Github to upload everything.

Please see https://store.steampowered.com/app/1860550/Space_Quest_2099/ for the full game

Full source is available on request, but only if you don't mind a fat old download.

**BLAST YOUR WAY through the UK's forgotten favourite space adventure: Space Quest 2099! Enjoy combat and movement based on the designs of the Quake 3 engine. Go alone or team up and shoot baddies in cooperative episodes with FULL MOTION VIDEO with SPECIAL EFFECTS!**

_Space Quest 2099_ is a stylised, multiplayer, sci-fi, action-driven first person shooter. Think Quake 3 meets Command and Conquer, complete with live action cutscenes, terribly cheesy one liners, and an utterly balls to the wall stupid cooperative campaign!  
  
Grab some friends and take control of Thunderchild's intrepid crew to embark on intergalactic space adventures! Alternatively, blow each other to **smithereens** in Space Quest's deathmatch suite!
